Integrate Hue lights and other home automation devices and services with HomeKit.

### About

This primarily exists to expose more of the Philips Hue Bridge API to Apple HomeKit than is directly supported by either the Philips or Apple mobile applications. For example, this allows starting a "dynamic scene" via a HomeKit automation, instead of only manually as is the case with the Hue application.

These flows also provide more sophisticated time-based automation than is supported natively by either Philips Hue or Apple Home. For example, these flows activate different holiday-themed scenes automatically based on the date. They also can drive window shade automation based on offsets from sunrise and sunset at a given location.
